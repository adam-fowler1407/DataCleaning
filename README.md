Data Cleaning Python script

Simple Python script to be used to effectivly clean CVS Files, and save in the same loaction

the goal will be for this script to be used before any data analysis attempt to clean, remove NAN Values, Putliers from numerical data, clean Column Names, Correct data types etc. 
the next stage will be to display some exploratory statistsic of the data, couple of simple vizulisations to help gain some insight into the data being analysised and kick start the main data analysis and modeling of the data.
